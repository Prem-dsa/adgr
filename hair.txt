Full Body Peel
What is a Full Body Peel?
A Full Body Peel is an advanced exfoliating treatment that rejuvenates the skin across your entire body by removing dead skin cells, improving texture, and restoring a brighter, smoother appearance. This treatment uses specially formulated chemical solutions—customised to your skin type—to target pigmentation, tanning, rough patches, keratosis, or uneven skin tone.
It’s ideal for people seeking overall skin glow, tan removal, softening of rough areas, and improved skin clarity—especially on areas like the back, arms, legs, and chest.

How Does the Procedure Work?
01/
Skin Assessment
Our experts analyse your skin type, tone, and concerns before choosing the ideal peel formulation.

02/
 Peel Application
A gentle chemical peel is applied section-by-section across the body. The solution works on the outermost layer to dissolve dead skin cells and promote regeneration.

03/
Aftercare Guidance
Post-treatment skincare tips are provided to ensure optimal healing and results.

04/
Pre-Cleansing & Preparation
The skin is cleansed thoroughly to remove surface oils and impurities.

Percutaneous Follicular Unit Extraction or FUE is the most advanced and state-of-the-art technique of hair transplantation at present. In contrast to the conventional FUE,it utilises pinpoint micromotors and ultra-thin punches (even 0.7–0.8 mm diameter) to isolate and harvest hair follicles individually with less trauma and accuracy to the scalp than traditional FUE. The difference with this process is the ability to control depth, direction, and density of follicle implantation at implantation that leads to extremely natural, dense and permanent outcomes.

How Does Percutaneous FUE Work?

Microblading
What is Microblading?
Microblading is a semi-permanent cosmetics tattoo technique to shape and define the brows. The treatment deposits pigment in outer skin layers using a thin, handheld blade. The most recent technology injects micro hairline strokes that perfectly match the natural eyebrow hair texture to create fuller appearing, more defined brows. This treatment is most suited for individuals that prefer a long-lasting solution to thin or asymmetrical brows as opposed to the makeup process daily.

How the Microblading Process Works ?
01/
Customised Consultation and Brow Mapping
Your journey starts with a consultation, during which our experienced experts evaluate your facial balance, bone structure, and your desired appearance. A tailored brow design is developed to complement your features and your desired appearance.

02/
Precision Strokes of Pigment Application
With a sterile, hand-held microblade, our expert gently places pigment into the skin in short, controlled strokes that mimic the appearance of natural brow hairs.

03/
Refining Sessions through Follow-Up
A few of follow-up appointments are scheduled for the greatest outcomes. These visits enable us to fine-tune the shape, color, or density according to how your skin holds pigment.

04/
Recovery and Final Outcome
Healing usually takes about 7 to 14 days, with the brows progressing through phases of light darkening, peeling, and softening. The final results in colour and shape are seen after four to six weeks, once the pigment has settled in the skin. If aftercare is proper, it is possible for your new brows to last as long as two years.

Why Choose Microblading?
Fuller, Defined Brows: Delicate strokes mimic natural hair for thicker, more defined brows.
Promotes Natural Growth: Microblading enhances your brows without affecting natural hair growth.
Fast & Low-Maintenance: Around three hours for lasting results.
What Conditions Does This Treatment Help With?

Thinning brows due to over-plucking, aging, or genetics.

Asymmetrical brows lacking shape and definition.

Hair loss caused by hormonal changes, illness, or trauma.

The daily need to fill in or shape brows with makeup.

A busy lifestyle leaving little time for beauty routines.

Lip Micropigmentation
What Exactly Is Lip Micropigmentation?
Lip Micropigmentation is a semi-permanent cosmetic procedure that enhances natural lip color, shape, and symmetry by implanting pigment into the upper skin layer. It creates defined, fuller-looking lips without daily lipstick. Ideal for correcting uneven pigmentation, restoring faded color, or achieving youthful, natural lips, it also helps conceal scars or discoloration. Unlike traditional makeup, it offers a long-lasting, safe, and effective solution.

How Does Lip Micropigmentation Work?
01/
Consultation and Customisation
First, our specialist will assess your lips’ shape, tone, and fullness to customize your needs and select the ideal pigment shade that enhances your natural lip color and skin tone.

02/
Treatment Process
The treatment takes about 3 hours, with a local anesthetic applied for comfort. A fine instrument implants pigment into the skin, appearing darker at first but settling within weeks to a subtle, natural color.

03/

Eyelash Lift & Extensions
What is Eyelash Lift and Extensions?
At AdGro, we blend precise lash styling with medical-grade safety for a refreshed eye look. An eyelash lift curls and lifts your natural lashes for a longer, open-eyed appearance without falsies, giving immediate, natural results.
Eyelash extensions add thin natural or synthetic lashes individually, creating length, fullness, and a smooth, dramatic finish.

How the Process Works ?
01/
Expert Consultation
Every lash line is unique. That is why we begin with a customised consultation where our lash specialists find out your eye shape, the type of lashes, and your beauty goals to recommend the most appropriate course of action.

02/
Lash Lift Application
For a lift, a specially formulated solution is swept across your lashes to curl them up gently at the root. This creates a naturally lifted effect that opens up your eyes and makes them appear more defined.

03/
Lash Extensions (Optional)
With extensions, extremely light lash strands are glued one at a time onto each individual lash with skin-friendly adhesive. This provides fullness, dimension, and a beautiful, natural finish to your lash line.

04/
Tinting Add-On (Optional)
Want to go darker or more defined? Add a lash or brow tint to deepen the pigment and enhance your final look—ideal for those who prefer a makeup-free routine.

05/
Aftercare & Maintenance Guidance
After your treatment, we give you complete aftercare instructions so you can get the most benefit for as long as you can. We recommend refilling extensions every 3-4 weeks to keep the volume consistent.

What Conditions Does This Treatment Help With?
Straight or downward-lashed lids that require structure or curl
Ongoing smudging or clumping of mascara
Thin or fine eyelashes that don’t play well with mascara
Time-saving beauty regimens—ideal for career women or brides-to-be
Why Eyelash Lift and Extensions?
Instant Gratification: Observe visible outcomes shortly after your session.
Extended Wear: Enjoy long-lasting results for up to 2–3 months with proper aftercare.
Safe and Painless: A comfortable process that doesn’t entail surgery, pain, or downtime.


Total Alopecia
What is Total alopecia treatment?
At AdGro, Nagercoil, we believe complete hair loss is not the end of your journey. Alopecia Totalis, a severe form of alopecia areata, causes full scalp hair loss, often due to autoimmune issues, stress, thyroid disease, or other conditions. It can progress rapidly and be emotionally difficult, but early treatment offers hope for regrowth.
Our approach focuses on each patient’s unique experience. We provide evidence-based, non-surgical treatments to stop hair loss, activate dormant follicles, and restore scalp health. Early diagnosis increases the chances of visible results.

How Does Total Alopecia Treatment Work?
01/
Comprehensive Assessment
Your treatment begins with a thorough consultation, in which we assess your scalp condition, medical history, hormonal markers, and autoimmune indicators. These are the cornerstones of your customised programme.

02/
Stopping Hair Loss
We concentrate on stopping active hair loss by treating its root cause—whether inflammation, immune dysregulation, or lack of nutrients. Early management is important to prevent additional follicular damage.

03/
Scalp Health Restoration
 A balanced scalp is essential for hair to grow. Through the regulation of sebum, correction of pH, and reduction of chronic inflammation, we create an optimal environment for recovery.

04/
Follicle Stimulation
Now comes the regrowth phase. Using cutting-edge technologies like LLLT, PRP, and topical growth enhancers, we encourage even the most stubborn follicles to re-enter the active growth cycle.

05/
Maintenance & Monitoring
Total Alopecia requires consistency. That’s why we provide long-term guidance, track your progress with advanced scalp analysis, and adapt your treatment as needed for best outcomes.

Mesotherapy
What is Mesotherapy?
Mesotherapy is a novel topical hair regenerating therapy that is used in pain-free hair restoration therapy. With mesotherapy, a special combination of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and growth factors is injected into the scalp to promote hair root growth, stimulate the scalp with increased blood supply, and provide nutrition to the hair root.
This therapy is especially great for people who have thinning hair, hair loss, and even hair loss at an early age. Pillowsing attacks the underlying causes of hair loss, while also creating the dormant follicles and initiating the natural process of regrowth of denser and healthier hair.

How Does Mesotherapy Work?
01/
Consultation & Scalp Assessment
Our qualified hair restoration experts examine your scalp condition, pattern of hair loss, and personal issues to create your own customised treatment protocol.

02/
Recovery & Results
Mesotherapy is a quick, no-downtime treatment. Mild redness may occur, with results visible in 4–6 weeks. A course of 4–8 sessions is recommended.

Nutrient Infusion Treatment
A nutrient-rich mix is injected into the scalp to nourish follicles, improve circulation, strengthen hair, and reduce hair loss.

What Exactly is PRP Pro+ for Hair?

Gel PRP
Advanced Fibrin-Rich Platelet Therapy for Tissue Regeneration
Gel PRP is an advanced form of Platelet-Rich Plasma therapy, processed into a gel for improved application and results. It accelerates tissue repair, stimulates collagen, and strengthens hair follicles via slow-release growth factors.
Activated with thrombin, it forms a fibrin matrix that supports sustained growth factor release and cellular regeneration. This promotes healing, hair follicle regeneration, and reactivates dormant follicles, naturally triggering hair growth. PRP Pro+ is a safe, minimally invasive, all-natural option for men and women.

How It Works:
01/
Blood is drawn from the patient and processed to isolate PRP

02/
Thrombin is added to initiate the formation of a fibrin-rich matrix.

03/
The PRP is further processed into a gel form.
