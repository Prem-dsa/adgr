Skin Peels
What Are Skin Peels?
Chemical peels gently remove outer skin layers to boost cell renewal, improving texture, tone, and brightness. They address acne, discoloration, fine lines, and dullness, offering natural, long-lasting results with minimal downtime.

How Do Skin Peels Work?
01/
Personalised Consultation
Your treatment starts with a thorough consultation conducted by our dermatology experts. We examine your lifestyle, skin type, and personal issues to choose the best peel and decide the right strength and number of sessions.

02/
Skin Preparation
A mild degreasing solution is used to gently clean and degrease the skin before your peel. This is for preparation of the peel so that it can evenly and effectively penetrate into the skin for optimal results.

03/
Application of the Peel
The chosen chemical solution is put on the treated area. You might feel a temporary tingling or warmth sensation. The peel breaks down adhesions of dead skin cells and causes cellular turnover.

04/
Neutralisation and Soothing
Subject to the peel being used, either it is neutralising itself or is removed along with a neutralising agent once a certain amount of time passes. The next step involves using a soothing serum or cooling mask to calm and help the skin recover.

05/
Aftercare Instructions
You’ll be given full post-treatment guidance, such as what skincare to steer clear of, how to deal with any redness or flakiness, and when to go back to your usual routine. We also suggest particular sunscreens and moisturisers to guard your newly fresh skin.

Face PRP
What Is Face PRP?
Face PRP, or the “Vampire Facial,” is likely the most holistic and advanced skin renewal procedure on the market today. Instead of resorting to artificial chemicals or surgery, PRP takes advantage of the body’s own healing ability. By drawing off a small vial of blood and filtering out its platelet-rich plasma, we can put back into your skin this concentrated factor of healing. The above is nothing less than a revolution—quicker collagen production, better skin texture, smoother finish, and healthy, radiant complexion that feels and looks like you, but better.

How It Works: The Step-by-Step Process
01/
Personalized Skin Consultation and Planning
Your process begins with a consultation to assess your skin, understand your needs, and create a tailored treatment plan—whether for wrinkles, acne scars, or dullness—ensuring goal-oriented results.

02/
Blood Collection and PRP Separation
After preparation, 10–15 ml of blood is drawn and spun in a centrifuge to separate golden platelet-rich plasma—packed with growth factors, collagen stimulators, and regenerative proteins.

03/
PRP Application
PRP can be applied by microneedling for overall collagen boost or injected directly into areas like under-eyes, smile lines, or acne scars for targeted rejuvenation.

04/
Recovery and Results
After treatment, mild redness or swelling may appear but usually subsides within 24–48 hours. Over the following weeks, collagen production increases, making skin plumper, brighter, and more even, with full results in 4–6 weeks and continued improvement for months.

Who It Benefits ?
